  "Use Convex directly in HTML with script tags, no build tools required"

Sometimes you just want to get your data on a web page: no installing packages,
no build steps, no TypeScript. Subscribing to queries deployed to an existing
Convex deployment from a script tag is simple.

import simpleHtml from "!!raw-loader!@site/../demos/html/simple.html";
import typedHtml from "!!raw-loader!@site/../demos/html/typed-example.html";
import script from "!!raw-loader!@site/../demos/html/script.js";

<Snippet
  source={simpleHtml}
  title="index.html"
  replacements={[[/https?:\/\/localhost:8000/g, "CONVEX_URL_GOES_HERE"]]}
/>

VS Code doesn't support TypeScript autocompletion in HTML files so for types and
better autocompletion you can split your code out into a script file:

<Snippet
  source={typedHtml}
  title="index.html"
  replacements={[[/https?:\/\/localhost:8000/g, "CONVEX_URL_GOES_HERE"]]}
/>
<Snippet
  source={script}
  title="script.js"
  replacements={[[/https?:\/\/localhost:8000/g, "CONVEX_URL_GOES_HERE"]]}
/>

See the [Script Tag Quickstart](/quickstart/script-tag.mdx) for instructions for
setting up a new Convex project.
