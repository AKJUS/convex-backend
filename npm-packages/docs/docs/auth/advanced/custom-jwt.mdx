**Note: This is an advanced feature!** We recommend sticking with the
[supported third-party authentication providers](/docs/auth.mdx).

If your custom auth provider implements the OIDC protocol, it's easiest to
configure it as a [Custom OIDC Provider](/auth/advanced/custom-auth). However,
some auth providers only issue JWTs and don't participate in the full OIDC
protocol. For example, [OpenAuth](https://openauth.js.org/) implements the OAuth
2.0 spec but not OIDC, so to use it with Convex you'll need to set it up as a
Custom JWT provider.

## Server-side integration

Use `type: "customJwt"` to configure a Custom JWT auth provider:

```js noDialect title="convex/auth.config.js"
export default {
  providers: [
    {
      type: "customJwt",
      applicationID: "your-application-id",
      issuer: "https://your.issuer.url.com",
      jwks: "https://your.issuer.url.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
      algorithm: "RS256",
    },
  ],
};
```

- `applicationID` (optional): If provided, Convex will verify that JWTs have
  this value in the `aud` claim.
- `issuer`: The issuer URL of the JWT.
- `jwks`: The URL for fetching the JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) from the auth
  provider.
- `algorithm`: The algorithm used to sign the JWT. Only RS256 and ES256 are
  currently supported. See
  [RFC 7518](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-3.1) for more
  details.

## Client-side integration

See the instructions for
[Custom OIDC Providers](/auth/advanced/custom-auth#client-side-integration).
