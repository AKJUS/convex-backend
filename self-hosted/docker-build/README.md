# Building docker images

The contents of this directory are used to build the docker images for the
self-hosted backend and dashboard. If you're looking for ways to run self-hosted
Convex, see the [these instructions](../README.md). You may build the images
locally from here, but we recommend using the images we provide on GHCR.
